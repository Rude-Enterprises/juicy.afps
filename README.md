# juicy.afps
A reddit/twitter bot that acts as the Jerry Springer of afps games.  The bot scrapes various subreddits of games like Quakelive, Quake Champions, Reflex, and compiles a list of the latest, most snarky comments (we'll call them juicy).  Juicy comments are chosen at random and posted to twitter every 3 hours!
